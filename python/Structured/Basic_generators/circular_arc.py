    #  DESCRIPTION
#  
#  A function to generate meshed rectangles
    
    #  Input: x0 - scalar - x-coordinate of center
#         y0 - scalar - y-coordinate of center
#         R1 - scalar - Inner radius
#         R2 - scalar - Outer radius
#         theta1 - scalar - Initial angle in radians
#         theta2 - scalar - Final angle in radians
#         Nr - scalar - Number of ELEMENTS in r-direction
#         Ntheta - scalar - Number of ELEMENTS in theta-direction
#  Output: mesh - (Nr+1)*(Ntheta+1) x 2 matrix - mesh nodes ordered through helical
#          indexing
